<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2749-nothing-in-this-world-can-take-the-place-of-persistence">
	<p> “Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.”

― Calvin Coolidge </p>
